# Computer-Network

## Introduction of the English version

This warehouse is used to store the experiments of my computer network class.

I will upload my program here after every assignment.

Maybe you can get some references here, although these experiments are very simple, and I'm sure you can do it on your own with just a little time.

In any case, I hope you have learned something from my code, and please point me out if there is anything wrong.

If you think these procedures are too simple (I'm sure most of them will), well, it's just an assignment
